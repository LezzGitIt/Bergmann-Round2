## Abstract 
We assembled a cross-continental dataset from 29 researchers to assess 1) whether three species of migratory nightjars (Family Caprimulgidae) adhere to Bergmann's rule, 2) if environmental factors on the breeding grounds or wintering grounds determine body size, and 3) which mechanistic hypotheses best explains Bergmannian patterns in body size. We captured 7,318 Caprimulgids (3,388 entered final analysis) using mist nets and conspecific playback across North America and Europe, a subset of 215 which were equipped with telemetry tags to obtain winter locations. We tested several mechanistic hypotheses that could explain Bergmannian clines across the annual cycle, thus birds have morphological measurements (mass and wing length), migratory distance, and environmental variables associated with breeding and winter locations. See methods and supporting information of the associated manuscript for additional information.

### Species

Eastern whip-poor-will (*Antrostomus vociferus*), Common nighthawk (*Chordeiles minor*), and European nightjar (*Caprimulgus europaeus*)

# Usage

## Instructions

All necessary code is provided to reproduce all analyses, figures, and tables in the main text of the manuscript ('Scripts/Final_JBI' folder). I recommend accessing the Dryad repo (link above) as the repo provides the necessary file structure, definitions of all columns in the data, etc. This repository **does** contain the version history of all scripts ('Scripts/Development' folder).

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Required R packages: R packages are called at the top of every script 

## License

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute this code however you wish. No restrictions apply.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the many researchers who provided morphological and tracking data on nightjars, the many field assistants and their tremendous effort capturing nightjars, and to Elly Knight and Alicia Korpach for their integral part in these analyses and the resulting manuscript.
